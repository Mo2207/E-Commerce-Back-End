# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description:

This application takes a functioning Express.js API and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
  - I built this project to practise using Sequelize methods to create, delete, and update data on a database.
  - Making this project I learned how associations help to create the relationships between Sequelize models.

This project can be used by running 'nodemon server.js' in the command-line or terminal. 
The databse can be seeded through the command-line or terminal as well using 'node seeds/index.js'.

## Credits:
I made this application myself, starting with the provided starter code for the module 13 assignment (the Express.js API).
